              Project timelines vary based on scope and complexity. A typical website
              project takes 6-8 weeks from kickoff to launch. Larger projects with
              custom functionality may take 12+ weeks. We'll provide a detailed
              timeline during our discovery phase.

              Absolutely. We often help clients improve or rebuild existing digital
              products. We'll start with an audit to understand the current state
              and provide recommendations for improvement.
